## User Registration and Authentication
1. **User Registration**
   - Successfully registered user "gs" with password "password123"
   - Successfully registered user "fbs" with password "securepwd456"
   - Correctly rejected attempt to register "gs" again with a different password
   - REGISTER response correctly includes the requested UID regardless of success/failure
   - When registering an existing user (duplicate), the response maintains the requested UID

2. **Login Authentication**
   - Successful login with correct credentials for both users
   - Failed login with incorrect passwords
   - Failed login attempts while another user is already logged in (session enforcement)
   - LOGIN response correctly includes the requested UID when login fails and no session is active
   - Failed login attempts (wrong password or nonexistent user) maintain the requested UID in response

3. **Password Management**
   - Failed password change attempts with incorrect old password
   - Failed attempts to change another user's password
   - Login attempts with supposed new passwords that were never actually changed failed correctly

## Session Management
1. **Session Enforcement**
   - Operations without active sessions correctly failed
   - Only one active session was allowed at a time
   - Login for a second user failed while first user was still logged in

2. **Logout Behavior**
   - Successful logout cleared active sessions
   - Logout without an active session correctly failed
   - LOGOUT response includes the UID of the previously logged-in user

## Key-Value Store Operations
1. **CREATE Operations**
   - CREATE failed without login
   - Successfully created keys when logged in
   - Failed to create keys that already exist

2. **READ Operations**
   - READ failed without login
   - Successfully read existing keys
   - Failed to read non-existent keys

3. **WRITE Operations**
   - Successfully modified existing keys
   - Failed to write to non-existent keys

4. **DELETE Operations**
   - Successfully deleted existing keys
   - Failed to delete non-existent keys
   - Case-sensitivity was properly enforced in key names

5. **COPY Operations**
   - Failed when either source or destination didn't exist
   - Successfully copied between existing keys
   - Case-sensitivity was properly enforced

## Protocol Security Features
1. **Replay Attack Prevention**
   - The nonce handling appears to be working correctly as there are no successful replay attacks in the tests

2. **Authentication Integrity**
   - Failed authentication attempts didn't compromise existing sessions
   - Failed operations didn't alter the state unexpectedly

## UID Handling in Responses
1. **REGISTER Response UID Handling**
   - Response UID matches request UID for successful user registration
   - Response UID matches request UID even when registration fails (duplicate user)

2. **LOGIN Response UID Handling**
   - Response UID matches request UID when login fails with nonexistent user
   - Response UID matches request UID when login fails with incorrect password
   - Response UID correctly reflects the logged-in user after successful login

3. **UID Consistency Across Operations**
   - After successful login, all operation responses maintain the logged-in user's UID
   - After logout, the UID in the logout response correctly reflects the previously logged-in user

## Testing Instructions
To run the UID handling tests, use the following command:
```
./main -f test/p2
```
