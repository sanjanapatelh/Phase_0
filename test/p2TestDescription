## User Registration and Authentication
1. **User Registration**
   - Successfully registered user "gs" with password "password123"
   - Successfully registered user "fbs" with password "securepwd456"
   - Correctly rejected attempt to register "gs" again with a different password

2. **Login Authentication**
   - Successful login with correct credentials for both users
   - Failed login with incorrect passwords
   - Failed login attempts while another user is already logged in (session enforcement)

3. **Password Management**
   - Failed password change attempts with incorrect old password
   - Failed attempts to change another user's password
   - Login attempts with supposed new passwords that were never actually changed failed correctly

## Session Management
1. **Session Enforcement**
   - Operations without active sessions correctly failed
   - Only one active session was allowed at a time
   - Login for a second user failed while first user was still logged in

2. **Logout Behavior**
   - Successful logout cleared active sessions
   - Logout without an active session correctly failed

## Key-Value Store Operations
1. **CREATE Operations**
   - CREATE failed without login
   - Successfully created keys when logged in
   - Failed to create keys that already exist

2. **READ Operations**
   - READ failed without login
   - Successfully read existing keys
   - Failed to read non-existent keys

3. **WRITE Operations**
   - Successfully modified existing keys
   - Failed to write to non-existent keys

4. **DELETE Operations**
   - Successfully deleted existing keys
   - Failed to delete non-existent keys
   - Case-sensitivity was properly enforced in key names

5. **COPY Operations**
   - Failed when either source or destination didn't exist
   - Successfully copied between existing keys
   - Case-sensitivity was properly enforced

## Protocol Security Features
1. **Replay Attack Prevention**
   - The nonce handling appears to be working correctly as there are no successful replay attacks in the tests

2. **Authentication Integrity**
   - Failed authentication attempts didn't compromise existing sessions
   - Failed operations didn't alter the state unexpectedly
